## The RStudio Community

We've randomly selected five individuals that have contributed content and received the greatest number of likes on [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/). We will be reaching out to each winner directly to be able to ship them their awards.

The first award is an RStudio t-shirt and all of the hex and RStudio stickers we can find.  The winners for the week of September 22nd are:
